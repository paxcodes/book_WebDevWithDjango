# Web Development with Django

Django projects and apps created while going through the book "Web Development with Django" from Packt Publishing (February 2021).

The code from Packt Publishing or the authors is also in [GitHub](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Web-Development-with-Django).

## Setting up Virtual Environment

The python version I used is 3.9.

1. `python -m venv --prompt "WebDevWithDjango" .venv`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
